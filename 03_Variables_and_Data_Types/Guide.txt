Answer Key

1. In Python, a variable functions as a name in which data is stored. It acts as a container that holds a value, and memory is allocated to it at the moment a value is assigned.
2. "Dynamically typed" means that one does not need to define the data type of a variable when it is created. The Python interpreter automatically detects the type of data assigned to the variable.
3. The three primary rules for naming variables are: they can only contain alphabets, digits, and underscores; they cannot start with a digit; and they are case-sensitive. Additionally, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.
4. To represent constants in Python, the convention is to write the variable name entirely in uppercase letters. Examples include PI = 3.14 and MAX_SPEED = 120.
5. The int data type is used for pure numbers without any decimal part, such as 10 or -5. The float data type, in contrast, is used for numbers that have a decimal point, like 3.14 or 0.95.
6. The NoneType data type corresponds to the None value. The purpose of None is to represent an empty or absent value, signifying that a variable has no value assigned to it.
7. The built-in type() function is used for type checking. When a value or variable is passed to this function, it returns the data type of that value or variable.
8. "Type casting" is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. The primary built-in functions used for this are int(), float(), str(), and bool().
9. The input() function is used to take input from a user via the console. By default, this function always returns the user's input as a string (str) data type.
10. A variable can be deleted using the del keyword. When del is used with a variable name (e.g., del x), the variable is removed from memory.

Essay Questions

Consider the following questions for a more in-depth analysis of the topic. Formulate comprehensive answers based on the source material.

1. Discuss the complete lifecycle of a variable in Python, from creation and memory allocation to the possibility of reassigning it with a different data type and its eventual deletion.
2. Analyze the rules for naming variables in Python. Explain the significance of each rule, provide valid and invalid examples for each, and discuss why using Python keywords as variable names is prohibited.
3. Compare and contrast at least five different built-in data types detailed in the source (e.g., str, bool, complex, NoneType, int). For each, describe the kind of data it represents and provide a clear example.
4. Explain the process of handling user input and performing type conversion in Python. Describe a scenario where failing to cast the type of data from the input() function would lead to an error or unexpected behavior.
5. While Python lacks formal constants, the convention of using uppercase names is a critical practice. Elaborate on the importance of this convention in writing clean, maintainable code and how it signals intent to other programmers.

Glossary of Key Terms

Term	Definition
bool (Boolean)	A data type representing one of two values: True or False.
complex	A data type for representing complex numbers, which have a real part and an imaginary part (e.g., 3 + 5j).
Constant	A value that is not intended to change. In Python, constants are represented by convention using variable names in all uppercase letters.
Data Types	The classification or categorization of data items. Basic built-in types include int, float, str, bool, complex, list, tuple, set, dict, and NoneType.
del	A Python keyword used to delete a variable and free up the memory it occupies.
Dynamically Typed	A characteristic of a programming language where the data type of a variable is determined at runtime by the interpreter, not by an explicit declaration.
float	A data type used for numbers that contain a decimal point.
input()	A built-in function that prompts the user for input and returns the provided data as a string.
int (Integer)	A data type used for pure, whole numbers without a decimal part.
Keywords	Reserved words in the Python language that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names.
Multiple Assignments	A feature in Python that allows the assignment of values to multiple variables in a single line of code.
NoneType	The data type of the None value, which is used to represent the absence of a value or an empty state.
str (String)	A data type used to store text data. Strings can be single-line or multi-line.
Type Casting	The process of converting a value from one data type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), and bool().
Type Checking	The process of verifying the data type of a variable. This is done using the built-in type() function.
Variable	A name used to store data in memory. A value is assigned to a variable, which can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program.
